* Verlet Integration

A repository to test working with emacs and cider.

   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2017-10-29 Sun 13:06]

** DONE test pointmass bouncing because gravity + floor. Only 'y' movement.
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2017-10-29 Sun 19:34]

** DONE test pointmass bouncing. Gravity + floor + dampening. Only 'y' movement
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2017-10-29 Sun 19:34]

** DONE test pointmass with 'x' & 'y' movement.
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2017-10-29 Sun 13:06]

** DONE Create threading macro:
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2017-10-30 Mon 23:04]
   -> @state
      update-points
      apply-stick-constraints
      apply-world-constraints
      reset! state
      render state
** DONE Connect pointmasses
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2017-10-30 Mon 23:04]
** TODO Make it work with multiple sticks
   (map partial ... (:sticks @State)
** TODO Edn file per 'world'. Initiate with edn file
** TODO Cloth! (zie mail link voor cloth generatie)
** TODO Mouse interaction with pointmasses
