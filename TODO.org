* Verlet Integration

A repository to test working with emacs and cider.

   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2017-10-30 Mon 23:03]

** DONE Create threading macro:
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2017-10-30 Mon 23:04]
** DONE Connect pointmasses
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2017-10-30 Mon 23:04]
** DONE Make it work with multiple sticks
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2017-11-03 Fri 10:23]
** DONE Edn file per 'world'. Initiate with edn file
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2017-11-03 Fri 11:39]

   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2017-11-03 Fri 11:49]
** DONE Cloth!
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2017-11-03 Fri 19:49]
** DONE Keyboard interaction to reset
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2017-11-03 Fri 13:02]
** DONE Mouse interaction with pointmasses
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2017-11-03 Fri 17:49]
** DONE Cleanup
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2017-11-04 Sat 12:51]
   - [X] Call defsketch from another function which is called in main (easier to
     test)
   - [X] Use Point Record (maybe no extra functions needed)
   - [X] Apply good enough styling
   - [X] Write README.
** CANCELLED Make cloth less stiff (generate cloth?)
   - State "CANCELLED"  from "TODO"       [2017-11-04 Sat 12:51]
   Trivial. Not the essence of what I started this project for
** CANCELLED Break stick when stretched beyond a max length
   - State "CANCELLED"  from "TODO"       [2017-11-04 Sat 12:51]
   Trivial. Not the essence of what I started this project for
** CANCELLED Create world where slow framerate clearly shows how next step is calculated
   - State "CANCELLED"  from "TODO"       [2017-11-04 Sat 12:51]
   Can already be done by simply changing framerate (and add a-world.edn if you
   want to)
** CANCELLED World generators (e.g. generate cloth)
   - State "CANCELLED"  from ""           [2017-11-04 Sat 12:52]
   Trivial. Not the essence of what I started this project for
** TODO Fix sticks moving out of the screen
